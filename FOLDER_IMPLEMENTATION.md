# Folder Implementation for Notes App

## Overview
This implementation adds Arc browser-style folder functionality to the notes sidebar, allowing users to organize notes into collapsible folders with full CRUD operations.

## PocketBase Database Changes Required

### 1. Create Folders Collection
Run the migration file: `pocketbase/pb_migrations/1749001600_created_folders.js`

**Collection Details:**
- **Name:** `folders`
- **Fields:**
  - `id` (text, primary key, auto-generated)
  - `name` (text, required, max 100 chars)
  - `user` (relation to users collection, required)
  - `expanded` (boolean, optional, default: true)
  - `created` (autodate)
  - `updated` (autodate)

**Access Rules:**
- **Create Rule:** `@request.auth.id != '' && @request.auth.id = user`
- **Read Rule:** `@request.auth.id != '' && @request.auth.id = user`  
- **Update Rule:** `@request.auth.id != '' && @request.auth.id = user`
- **Delete Rule:** `@request.auth.id != '' && @request.auth.id = user`

**Indexes:**
- `idx_folders_user` on `user` field
- `idx_folders_name` on `name` field

### 2. Update Notes Collection
Run the migration file: `pocketbase/pb_migrations/1749001700_updated_notes_folder_relation.js`

**New Field:**
- `folder_id` (relation to folders collection, optional)
  - Allows notes to be associated with folders
  - `null` value means note is at root level

## Migration Commands

1. Stop your PocketBase server
2. Run: `./pocketbase migrate up`
3. Start your PocketBase server

## Features Implemented

### Folder Management
- ✅ Create folders via button or right-click context menu
- ✅ Rename folders (inline editing)
- ✅ Delete folders (moves notes to root level)
- ✅ Expand/collapse folders with smooth animations
- ✅ Visual indicators for open/closed state

### Note Organization
- ✅ Move notes between folders via context menu
- ✅ Move notes to root level
- ✅ Preserve note pinning within folders
- ✅ Search functionality works across all notes regardless of folder

### User Experience
- ✅ Arc browser-style folder design
- ✅ Context menus for all operations
- ✅ Smooth animations and transitions
- ✅ Responsive design for mobile/desktop
- ✅ Keyboard shortcuts for folder operations
- ✅ Visual note count per folder

## API Functions Added

### Folder Operations
- `createFolder(name: string): Promise<Folder>`
- `getFolders(): Promise<Folder[]>`
- `updateFolder(id: string, data: Partial<Folder>): Promise<Folder>`
- `deleteFolder(id: string): Promise<boolean>`
- `toggleFolderExpanded(id: string, expanded: boolean): Promise<Folder>`

### Note-Folder Operations
- `moveNoteToFolder(noteId: string, folderId: string | null): Promise<Note>`

## UI/UX Design

### Folder Appearance
- **Closed Folder:** Folder icon with chevron pointing right
- **Open Folder:** FolderOpen icon with chevron pointing down
- **Hover Effects:** Subtle background color change
- **Note Count:** Displayed on the right side of folder name

### Context Menus
- **Sidebar Right-Click:** Create new folder, create new note
- **Folder Right-Click:** Rename folder, delete folder
- **Note Right-Click:** Pin/unpin, move to folders, move to root

### Animations
- **Folder Toggle:** Smooth height transition with opacity fade
- **Chevron Rotation:** 90-degree rotation on expand/collapse
- **Note Movements:** Layout animations when moving between folders

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
- Uses React Query for server state management
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Proper error handling and loading states
- Cache invalidation strategies

### Component Architecture
- `NotesSidebar`: Main container component
- `NoteItem`: Reusable note display component with context menu
- Folder rendering integrated into sidebar with proper nesting

### Performance Optimizations
- Memoized sorting functions
- Efficient re-rendering with proper dependencies
- Lazy loading of folder contents
- Debounced search functionality

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation
- Falls back to showing all notes if folder data fails to load
- Handles missing user fields for backward compatibility
- Auto-cancellation detection for aborted requests

### User Feedback
- Loading states for all operations
- Error messages for failed operations
- Success confirmations for destructive actions

## Accessibility

- ✅ Keyboard navigation support
- ✅ Screen reader friendly labels
- ✅ Focus management for inline editing
- ✅ ARIA attributes for expandable content

## Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers with ES6+ support
- Mobile responsive design
- Touch-friendly interface elements

## Production Considerations

### Security
- User-scoped data access
- Proper authentication checks
- SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries

### Performance
- Indexed database queries
- Efficient sorting algorithms
- Minimal re-renders with proper memoization

### Scalability
- Supports unlimited folders per user
- Efficient querying with proper indexes
- Optimized for large numbers of notes

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Unit Tests:**
   - API function error handling
   - Sorting and organization logic
   - Component rendering with different states

2. **Integration Tests:**
   - Folder CRUD operations
   - Note movement between folders
   - Search functionality across folders

3. **E2E Tests:**
   - Complete folder workflows
   - Context menu interactions
   - Mobile responsive behavior

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
- Drag and drop note movement
- Nested folders (subfolders)
- Folder color coding
- Bulk note operations
- Folder templates
- Export/import folder structures

### Performance Improvements
- Virtual scrolling for large note lists
- Incremental loading of folder contents
- Background sync for offline support
