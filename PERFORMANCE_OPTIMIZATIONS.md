# Tiptap Editor Performance Optimizations

This document outlines the comprehensive performance optimizations implemented to address typing lag and improve overall editor responsiveness, particularly on lower-end devices.

## Performance Issues Addressed

### Primary Causes of Typing Lag
1. **React Re-renders**: Excessive component re-renders on every keystroke
2. **FontFamily Extension Overhead**: DOM queries and font calculations on each input
3. **React Node Views**: React components re-rendering unnecessarily in ProseMirror
4. **Autosave Frequency**: Too aggressive saving impacting typing performance
5. **CSS Layout Thrashing**: Frequent reflows and repaints during typing

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Tiptap Core Configuration
- ✅ `shouldRerenderOnTransaction: false` - Prevents React re-renders on every transaction
- ✅ `immediatelyRender: false` - Optimizes initial render performance
- ✅ Disabled spellcheck - Major cause of typing lag on lower-end devices
- ✅ Optimized editor history settings - Reduced memory usage and improved undo/redo

### 2. React Component Optimizations
- ✅ **Heavy memoization** of all toolbar components
- ✅ **useEditorState hook** for minimal re-renders when checking editor state
- ✅ **Custom memo comparisons** to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- ✅ **Stable callback references** to prevent component re-creation
- ✅ **Memoized extension configuration** to prevent re-instantiation

### 3. FontFamily Extension Optimizations
- ✅ **Lazy font family calculations** - Only compute when dropdown opens
- ✅ **Memoized font options** - Prevent re-creation of option components
- ✅ **Reduced DOM queries** - Cache font family state
- ✅ **Optimized Typography extension** - Disabled performance-heavy transforms

### 4. React Node Views Performance
- ✅ **Comprehensive memoization** of ImageUploadNode and all sub-components
- ✅ **useCallback hooks** for all event handlers
- ✅ **Memoized upload options** to prevent object re-creation
- ✅ **Optimized drag and drop handlers** with proper cleanup

### 5. Autosave Optimizations
- ✅ **Increased debounce delay** from 2s to 3s for better typing performance
- ✅ **Smarter change detection** - Ignore trivial changes (< 3 characters)
- ✅ **Reduced status update frequency** to minimize re-renders

### 6. CSS Performance Optimizations
- ✅ **GPU acceleration** with `transform: translateZ(0)` on editor and toolbar
- ✅ **Layout containment** with `contain: layout style paint`
- ✅ **Optimized font rendering** with `text-rendering: optimizeSpeed`
- ✅ **Disabled smooth scrolling** for better performance
- ✅ **Hardware-accelerated dropdowns** and menus

### 7. Development Performance Monitoring
- ✅ **Render count tracking** in development mode
- ✅ **Performance logging** for debugging re-render issues

## Performance Metrics Expected

### Before Optimizations
- **Typing lag**: 50-200ms on lower-end devices
- **Re-renders per keystroke**: 5-15 component re-renders
- **Font family queries**: Multiple DOM queries per keystroke
- **React Node View updates**: All node views re-render on selection change

### After Optimizations
- **Typing lag**: <50ms on most devices
- **Re-renders per keystroke**: 1-3 component re-renders
- **Font family queries**: Only when dropdown opens
- **React Node View updates**: Only affected nodes re-render

## Best Practices for Maintaining Performance

### 1. Component Development
- Always use `React.memo()` for Tiptap-related components
- Implement custom comparison functions for complex props
- Use `useCallback` and `useMemo` appropriately
- Avoid inline object/function creation in render

### 2. Extension Configuration
- Keep extension options stable with `useMemo`
- Disable unnecessary features in extensions
- Use lazy loading for heavy operations

### 3. CSS Guidelines
- Use `contain` property for layout isolation
- Apply GPU acceleration selectively with `transform: translateZ(0)`
- Avoid expensive CSS properties during typing (animations, transitions)
- Use `will-change` sparingly and clean up after use

### 4. Autosave Configuration
- Set appropriate debounce delays (3s recommended)
- Implement smart change detection
- Use optimistic updates for better UX

## Monitoring Performance

### Development Tools
```javascript
// Enable performance monitoring in development
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
  console.log(`SimpleEditor render count: ${renderCount}`)
}
```

### React DevTools Profiler
1. Open React DevTools
2. Go to Profiler tab
3. Start recording
4. Type in the editor
5. Check for unnecessary re-renders

### Browser Performance Tools
1. Open Chrome DevTools
2. Go to Performance tab
3. Record typing session
4. Look for layout thrashing and excessive paint operations

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### High CPU Usage During Typing
- Check for components without `React.memo`
- Look for unstable callback references
- Verify extension configurations are memoized

### Font Family Dropdown Lag
- Ensure `activeFontInfo` is properly memoized
- Check that font options are not recreated on each render
- Verify dropdown only opens when needed

### Image Upload Performance
- All ImageUploadNode components should be memoized
- Check for proper cleanup of drag/drop handlers
- Ensure upload options are stable

### Autosave Interfering with Typing
- Increase debounce delay if needed
- Check change detection logic
- Verify save operations don't block UI

## Version History

### v1.0 (Current)
- Initial comprehensive performance optimization
- Addresses all major causes of typing lag
- Optimizes for lower-end devices
- Includes development monitoring tools

## Future Optimizations

### Potential Improvements
- **Virtual scrolling** for very large documents
- **Web Workers** for heavy computations
- **Service Worker caching** for fonts and assets
- **Progressive enhancement** for feature loading

### Monitoring
- Implement real-time performance metrics
- Add automated performance regression tests
- Create performance budgets for CI/CD

## Quick Reference: Key Settings

```typescript
// Editor Configuration
const editor = useEditor({
  immediatelyRender: false,
  shouldRerenderOnTransaction: false,
  editorProps: {
    attributes: {
      spellcheck: "false", // Critical for performance
    },
  },
})

// Autosave Configuration
const autosave = useAutosave(noteId, title, content, {
  delay: 3000, // 3 second debounce
  isChanged: (current, previous) => {
    // Smart change detection
    const currentTrimmed = current.trim()
    const previousTrimmed = previous.trim()
    return currentTrimmed !== previousTrimmed && 
           Math.abs(currentTrimmed.length - previousTrimmed.length) >= 3
  },
})
```

This optimization package should provide significant performance improvements, especially on lower-end devices where typing lag was most noticeable.
