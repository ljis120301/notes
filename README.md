## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Setup PocketBase
The app uses PocketBase for the backend. You need to run the migration to add image upload support:

```bash
# Navigate to the PocketBase directory
cd pocketbase

# Run PocketBase (this will apply the new migration automatically)
./pocketbase serve
```

The migration `1748896000_created_note_images.js` will automatically create the `note_images` collection for file uploads.

### 3. Start the Development Server
```bash
# In the project root (not in pocketbase directory)
npm run dev
```

### 4. Access the Application
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **PocketBase Admin**: http://localhost:8090/_/
- **PocketBase API**: http://localhost:8090/api/

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Performance Optimizations
1. **ContentEditable with cursor preservation** - Direct DOM manipulation
2. **Server update detection** - Prevents cursor reset during auto-save
3. **Debounced sync** - Content synced to React state every 300ms
4. **Real-time CSS styling** - No heavy markdown parsing
5. **Local backup** - Automatic localStorage backup for data safety

### Cursor Preservation System
1. **Save cursor position** before any content updates
2. **Detect server updates** vs user input
3. **Restore cursor position** only for user-initiated changes
4. **Maintain typing flow** during auto-save operations

### File Upload Flow
1. User clicks image upload button
2. File validated and uploaded to PocketBase
3. PocketBase returns secure file URL
4. Markdown image syntax inserted at cursor position
5. Real-time CSS styling shows the markdown syntax

### Data Management
- **TanStack Query** for server state management
- **Optimistic updates** for instant UI feedback
- **Background sync** for reliable data persistence
- **Cursor-aware updates** for seamless editing experience

## üîß Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Editor**: ContentEditable with real-time CSS styling
- **State Management**: TanStack Query, React hooks
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: PocketBase with file storage
- **Icons**: Lucide React

## üéØ User Experience Philosophy

This editor provides a **seamless writing experience** that combines the best of both worlds:

- **Familiar typing experience** - Just type and see results instantly
- **No mode switching** - No need to switch between edit/preview
- **Visual feedback** - See formatting as you type markdown
- **Never lose your place** - Cursor position preserved during saves
- **Progressive enhancement** - Raw markdown works, styling enhances it

## üîí Data Safety

- **Auto-save with cursor preservation** prevents data loss without interruption
- **Local backup** in localStorage as secondary safety net
- **Server update detection** prevents cursor jumping
- **Error recovery** with manual save retry options
- **Graceful degradation** if JavaScript fails

---

The unified editor provides the fastest and most natural markdown editing experience while maintaining all the performance benefits and data safety of the original implementation.

### 1. PocketBase Configuration

#### Collection Rules for Public Sharing

To enable public sharing with image access, you need to configure your PocketBase collection rules:

1. Open PocketBase Admin UI (usually at `http://localhost:6969/_/`)
2. Go to Collections ‚Üí `notes`
3. Click on the "API Rules" tab
4. Update the rules as follows:

**List Rule:**
```
@request.auth.id != "" || isPublic = true
```

**View Rule:**
```
@request.auth.id != "" || isPublic = true
```

**Create Rule:**
```
@request.auth.id != ""
```

**Update Rule:**
```
@request.auth.id != "" && (@request.auth.id = user || @request.auth.id = author)
```

**Delete Rule:**
```
@request.auth.id != "" && (@request.auth.id = user || @request.auth.id = author)
```

#### File Access Configuration

For images in shared notes to be publicly accessible:

1. In the `notes` collection, find any file fields (like image uploads)
2. For each file field, check the "Protected" option
3. The file access will automatically follow the collection's View rule

This ensures that:
- Private notes and their images require authentication
- Public notes (where `isPublic = true`) and their images are accessible without authentication
- Only authenticated users can create, update, or delete notes

### 2. Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_POCKETBASE_URL=http://localhost:6969
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Run Development Server

```bash
# Start PocketBase (in one terminal)
cd pocketbase
./pocketbase serve --dev

# Start Next.js (in another terminal)
npm run dev
```

## Public Sharing

The public sharing feature allows users to:

1. Click the Share button on any note
2. Generate a public link using the note's existing ID
3. Share the link with anyone
4. Viewers can access the note without authentication
5. Images and formatting are preserved in shared notes

**Security Notes:**
- Only notes explicitly marked as `isPublic = true` are accessible via public links
- Private notes remain protected even if someone guesses the URL
- File access follows the same rules as note access

## Architecture

- **Frontend:** Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Backend:** PocketBase (SQLite + REST API)
- **Editor:** Tiptap (rich text editor)
- **UI:** Shadcn/ui components
- **State:** TanStack Query + Zustand
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS

## Development

The app uses a simplified sharing system:
- No separate UUID generation
- Uses PocketBase's existing record IDs
- Relies on `isPublic` boolean field for access control
- Collection rules handle security automatically
