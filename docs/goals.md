# Goals 
What are my goals for the project? What am I still wanting to add?

- More themes! For the editor and the page, something that it totally different and more old school physical notebook type vibe 
- Arc like pinned favorites 
- ✅ Single account multi-editor situation edge cases, eg. Editing on macbook, tab is open on desktop
  - **COMPLETED**: Implemented real-time sync with PocketBase SSE
  - **COMPLETED**: Smart conflict resolution with auto and manual modes
  - **COMPLETED**: Enhanced sync status indicator with visual feedback
  - **COMPLETED**: Seamless integration with existing auto-save functionality
- Multi-account access 
- Email registration 
- Clear Logo 
- Animated sidebar tabs, dropping to the bottom from being unpinned, being pinned, becoming the new top position in the stack
- Auto-save states not properly dispalyed, eg. If unsaved progress exists, then still shows green checkmark, This should show Yellow when unsaved new progress, Red when no save progress, Green when a DB call is made to check the hash of both files and determine if they are the same file
- Larger Photo support
- Docker container that works
